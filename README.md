# Mean-Variance-Standard Deviation Calculator

This project implements a simple calculator to compute the mean, variance, and standard deviation of a 3x3 matrix using NumPy. It's a foundational exercise in matrix manipulation and statistical operations.

## 📐 Features

- Accepts a list of 9 numerical values.
- Converts the list into a 3x3 NumPy array.
- Calculates the following metrics:
  - Mean
  - Variance
  - Standard deviation
  - Max, Min, and Sum (per row, column, and overall)

## 🧮 Technologies

- Python
- NumPy

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone this repository.
2. Open `mean_var_std.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook.
3. Execute the notebook to see the statistical summary of the input array.

## 📌 Notes

This project is useful for understanding NumPy's `axis` argument and array-based statistical operations.
